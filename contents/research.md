- Soil microbial responses to multiple global climate changes in grassland ecosystems
	- Utilized multi-omics approaches to analyze the responses of soil microbial communities to prolonged (>10 years) global climate changes (elevated CO2, warming, nitrogen addition, increased precipitation, and wildfire occurrences) within the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment.

- Effects of season and experimental warming on soil bacterial functional traits in grasslands
	- Investigated the temporal dynamics of soil microbial functional traits over 12 consecutive months under experimental warming in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem.
	- Showed that during the cool months, warming induced a soil microbiome with higher genomic potential for carbon decomposition, community-level ribosomal RNA operon copy numbers, and microbial metabolic quotients, suggesting that warming stimulated fast-growing microorganisms that enhanced carbon decomposition.

- Revisiting the classical biodiversity-ecosystem functioning and stability relationships in microbial microcosms
	- Examined variations in maximum specific growth rate, productivity, mortality, and species interactions within artificial microbial communities across a diversity gradient (1 to 16 species) under normal, starvation, and saline stress, highlighting the strong context-dependence of biodiversity-ecosystem function/stability relationships.
